# BeyondPixels
The Art of Satellite Data Visualization

SAR data was brought into the real world, bridging the gap between the physical and the digital. A physical, mutable DEM was made that can be interacted with through processed HGT data is turned into 3D models. The challenge was solved by allowing a easily visualized model that can show change over time for large-scale geological events. The model brings importance to those who learn and process information best in a tactical way, beyond pixels. 

Data Collection - Collection of files for data point collection from HRT files. HGT files not included due to file size. Includes a photo folder of our topography maps
Data Manipulation - Collection of files that take the collected data and turns it into a stl file that will be sliced for our mechanism. Includes a jpg of a 3D representation of processed data 
Mechanism - 3D modelling of our physical DEM mechanisms. Includes a png of what a model print could look like
